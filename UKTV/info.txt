Hi T2s, especially Prods

I need your advice about an issue UKTV is facing with their Android mobile app

This issue (black screen + audio only + blinking) only can be seen with the following devices: Samsung A40, A50 and A70 and also occurs only with newly uploaded videos.

Here are 3 videos of the tests I did to reproduce the issue with our Android BasicSampleApp:

1) Test video 6075307114001 (DRM):
https://players.brightcove.net/5470155822001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6109725762001

2) Test video 6093497274001 (DRM): (black screen + audio only + blinking)
https://players.brightcove.net/5470155822001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6109722040001

3) Test video 5988320994001 (No DRM):
https://players.brightcove.net/5470155822001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6110145504001


FYI:
UKTV account: 1242911124001
UKTV video 6075307114001 was created on Aug 21, 2019 8:20 PM +01:00 
UKTV video 6093497274001 was created on Oct 9, 2019 6:20 PM +01:00
UKTV video 5988320994001 was created on Jan 11, 2019 11:08 AM +00:00


The Ingest Profile used for these videos was: UKTV_Play_Dynamic_Delivery_profile
Both videos have DRM enabled
The customer believes that something in the video delivery must have changed, which has resulted in Samsung A40/A50/A70 users not being able to watch any of the recent content.
As both videos were ingested with the UKTV_Play_Dynamic_Delivery_profile I don’t see difference in the renditions created for both videos in the VC Studio or the video sources in Jackie pages. Also, my Prod knowledge is limited and not sure what else to look at.
For sure this will end up in a JIRA but I would like to provide all the information necessary, maybe you can spot something before I submit this to Engineering.
Thanks in advance (edited)

the only thing that comes to my mind is capturing charles logs for both examples
https://sites.google.com/a/brightcove.com/cs/t1/t1-tools/how-to-install-charles/configuring-charles-proxy-to-inspect-traffic-over-cellular-networks
and then compare them
particularly, double check if the same type of URL is requested
and if that’s the case, examine as well the request and response headers, in case there is something different (edited) 
Am I understanding this started to happen with  recent videos, right?
it could perfectly be something introduced on ZC
but it’s very strange to me the whole screen seems to blink and not just the video (am I right?)
Anousak Litnhouvongs 1:20 PM
yeap seems like the whole screen phone is blinking
do they still have the source file for video ID 6075307114001
or any old video that works?
cause they could try to re ingest the same master now
and see if the new video ID has blinking
you know what i mean?
Juan Saavedra 1:22 PM
I have Charles logs and Logcats logs collected for both tests.
Anousak Litnhouvongs 1:23 PM
i would test as well to deactivate DRM for a video blinking
since we can deactivate DRM
does it happen for ALL their new videos?
can you upload a test video in their account and try it?
Juan Saavedra 1:25 PM
their Ingest profile doesn’t store the master file, I have requested this before but their internal security procedures don’t allow them to give us this video.
I tested this with DRM disabled, and the the video is not showing black screen but it blinks (edited) 
Yes, it happens with new videos, but not sure since when…
They’re constantly uploading videos and I see the same issue
weird weird case
Anousak Litnhouvongs 1:27 PM
a video from us, would rule out it’s not the way they encode their videos
Juan Saavedra 1:27 PM
but as is only affecting these 3 devices
Anousak Litnhouvongs 1:28 PM
and if the non DRM video blinks but has no black screen

then we have 2 issues…
Juan Saavedra 1:28 PM
got it
